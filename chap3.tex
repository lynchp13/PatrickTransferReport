\section{Simulation Tools}

\subsection{Gazebo}
\subsection{MoveIt}
\subsection{RVIZ}
\subsection{ROS}

\section{Test Platforms}
Open Source, Community Developed, Custom Developed manipulators and grippers

\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Experimental Set-up}

Each platform tested on an established benchmark on a range of applications.
Creates a matrix of grippers against applications and performance.
Distil from this why each performed well or poorly and deduce what functionality, sensing, etc is need to perform well in each.

Next add extra sensing to the tested platforms, 2 categories of sensing, local and global (possibly 3, added tactile, added embedded camera, added global camera). Run tests on each gripper with added local sensing and added global sensing and evaluate the effect on performance.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
Speed
Robustness
Accuracy
Range of Objects
Success Rate
